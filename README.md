# Solidity Smart Contract: Understanding require(), assert(), and revert()

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. These statements are essential for enforcing preconditions, and validating internal state, Require(), assert(), and revert() statements are used in a simple Solidity smart contract that is included in this repository. These are the fundamental statements that smart contract developers need to handle special instances, validate internal states, and enforce preconditions.and handling exceptional cases in smart contract development.

## Requirements

### To interact with the smart contract, you'll need:
An Ethereum smart contract development environment (such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat). An Ethereum wallet or client (like MetaMask) for testnet or mainnet deployment and communication with the contract. 

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: [Click here.](https://github.com/xlia023/Functions-and-Errors.git)
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd solidity-assertions
3. Open the RequireAssertRevert.sol file in your preferred Solidity development environment.
4.  Compile the smart contract.
5. Deploy the smart contract to your desired Ethereum network (testnet or mainnet).
6. Interact with the deployed contract using the provided functions, such as setNumber().

## Code Explanation
- require(): Used to enforce conditions that must be met for a function to execute successfully. It helps validate inputs and prevent invalid state changes.
- assert(): Checks for internal errors and invariant violations within the contract. It's crucial for ensuring the integrity of the contract's state.
- revert(): Reverts a transaction with a specified error message. It's useful for handling exceptional cases and aborting transactions when certain conditions aren't met.
